Work done: I changed the title of the website to Horiseon Home Page. I added a di to the search engine optimization content so that users could jump to that portion of the page when they click on it. I consolidated the code in css by laying it out in order. Here's the order of the sections: general, header and nav, hero, content and footer section. I deleted unnessary code like </image> at the end of image code. I added alt tags to all the images for best practices.
